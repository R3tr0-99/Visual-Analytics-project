# Deprecated Components

This folder contains components that are no longer used in the application but are kept for reference.

## Files moved here during optimization:

- `barChart.jsx` - Not referenced in the main application
- `radarNoVectorChart.jsx` - Not referenced in the main application  
- `apiTest.jsx` - Development-only API test, removed from production code

These files can be safely deleted if not needed for future reference.
